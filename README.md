# AVR Pin Control Library

A lightweight and efficient library for controlling pins on AVR microcontrollers using macros and inline functions. This library allows direct manipulation of pin states and modes, making it ideal for low-level hardware control.

## Difference Between Using Arduino Functions and Macros

When working with AVR microcontrollers, developers often use the Arduino framework for convenience. While Arduino functions like `digitalWrite()`, `pinMode()`, and `digitalRead()` are easy to use and abstract the hardware details, they come with some trade-offs compared to using macros or direct register manipulation.

### Arduino Functions

1. **Ease of Use**:
   - Functions like `digitalWrite(pin, HIGH)` are intuitive and readable.
   - No need to know about registers or bit manipulation.

2. **Portability**:
   - Code written with Arduino functions can work across multiple microcontrollers supported by Arduino without modification.

3. **Performance**:
   - These functions have additional overhead as they include checks, validation, and abstractions.
   - On an AVR running at 16 MHz, `digitalWrite()` can take approximately 50 clock cycles or more to execute.

### Macros and Direct Register Manipulation

1. **Efficiency**:
   - Macros like `SET_PIN_HIGH(PORTB, PB0)` directly manipulate the hardware registers, resulting in near-instant execution (usually within 1-2 clock cycles).
   - Critical for time-sensitive applications such as high-frequency toggling or precise timing.

2. **Low-Level Control**:
   - Provides direct access to microcontroller features without unnecessary abstraction.
   - Ideal for scenarios where performance and resource usage are priorities.

3. **Complexity**:
   - Requires understanding of AVR registers (`PORTx`, `DDRx`, `PINx`) and bitwise operations.
   - Less portable as the code is tightly coupled with the specific microcontrollerâ€™s hardware.

### Comparison Table

| Feature                     | Arduino Functions      | AVR Macros/Direct Registers    |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**             | High                  | Low                             |
| **Performance**             | Moderate (High Overhead)| High (Low Overhead)            |
| **Portability**             | High                  | Low                             |
| **Timing Critical Applications** | Not Ideal          | Ideal                           |
| **Abstraction**             | High                  | Low                             |

### Conclusion

If you're working on a simple project where timing and performance are not critical, Arduino functions are a great choice for their ease of use and abstraction. However, for time-sensitive tasks or when maximum efficiency is required, using this library's macros for direct control of pins is the better option.

## Features

- **Set, Clear, Toggle, and Read Pins** with simple macros.
- **Configure Pins as Input or Output** easily.
- **Inline Functions** for type safety and more readable code.
- Minimal overhead for performance-critical applications.
- Portable across different AVR microcontrollers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

    // Configure LED_PIN as output
    SET_PIN_OUTPUT(DDRB, LED_PIN);

    // Configure BUTTON_PIN as input
    SET_PIN_INPUT(DDRB, BUTTON_PIN);

    while (1) {
        // Read button state and set LED state accordingly
        if (READ_PIN(PINB, BUTTON_PIN)) {
            SET_PIN_HIGH(PORTB, LED_PIN);
        } else {
            SET_PIN_LOW(PORTB, LED_PIN);

    }
    return 0;
}
```
